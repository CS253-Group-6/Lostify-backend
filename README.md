## Description

Lostify is an Android application that provides a self-contained, localised platform for the IIT Kanpur community to report found items and reclaim lost items easily. The platform connects students, faculty, administration, and security staff alike and facilitates quick and efficient communication and resolution, besides clearing the clutter of message communities and email regarding misplaced or unclaimed items that may not be circulated to the campus community as a whole.
